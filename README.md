Research on COM-Poisson-Skellam Regression
==========================================

#This is the work I did when I was a research assistant in Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Georgetown University, Washington DC

#Advisor: Kimberly F Sellers, Assistant Professor in Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Georgetwon University, Washington DC. contact: kfs7@georgetown.edu

#To give a brief introduction of my work in the research:
Prof. Sellers proposed a distribution called COM-Poisson distribution, which is used to model the difference of two groups of counting data with same dispersion parameters and different means. my job is to find a implement a method for regression analysis based on this regression.
