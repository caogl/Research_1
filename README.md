Research on COM-Poisson-Skellam Regression
==========================================

--This is the work I did when I was a research assistant in Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Georgetown University, Washington DC

--Advisor: Kimberly F Sellers, Assistant Professor in Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Georgetwon University, Washington DC. contact: kfs7@georgetown.edu

--To give a brief introduction of my work in the research:

Prof. Sellers proposed a distribution called COM-Poisson Skellam distribution, which is used to model the difference of two groups of counting data with same dispersion parameters but different means. My job is to find and implement a method for regression analysis based on this distribution.

--I'm in the research team of three. Prof. Sellers is the leader who derived the COM-Poisson-Skellam distribution and we have group meeting every week. Prof. Andew tried to apply bayesian modelling and I tried to derive the regression method based on this distribution.
